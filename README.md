# Node-React-MySQL-CrudApp
Simple CRUD app so I could learn more about Node.js and ReactJS

Both folders do not include the 'node modules' folders because there were too many items and GitHub did not allow the upload

The files of importance are index.js in the backendserver folder and AApp.js folder in the src folder of the frontendclient folder. Other minor files of importance are the App.css file in the /frontendclient/src, package.json, and package-lock.json - both in /backendserver.
